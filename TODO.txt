Should we let the users make two or more notification with same name and subject?yes (done)
Thinking of taking out the name attribute from the new notification because it make no sense. (name stays)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/10/2016(Jaelse)

How the users can get all the notifications they had and lost after uninstalling the app and then reinstalling.

When the app is reinstalled then all the notifications from all the broadcasts subscribed will be loaded
and then those according to their time stamp and then inserted to the local database.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9/10/2016(Jaelse)

The home fragment listview will only show name of the notification as the heading and then the name of the
broadcast below that and as the content there only be the subject. In the last the time will be shown.
When the notification willbe tapped, a new activity will be opened which will have all the information.

Connect the local database with the listview in the home fragment.(done)
make the listview dynamic.(done)

Do what is there in 3/10/2016.(done. testing after nischal's work)

asynchronize(done)


need to put the link of icon8.

The name of the notification should not be greater than 30 letters.
The subject of the notification should not be greater than 100 letters.


#009688 color I used for ic_tab_notifications.


Next thing to do:
The local database should be refreshed if the user sign in with different account. Refreshing means
to delete all the data from the local database and then loading the data again from the remote database.
(Task done. need to check when nischal put timestamp in all the notifications.)
